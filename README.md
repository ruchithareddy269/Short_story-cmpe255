# Applicant Screening System Using Natural Language Processing
## Abstract
This project presents a cutting-edge web application for screening resumes in line with particular job postings. It effectively shortlists qualified candidates by utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP), which helps hiring companies and job seekers alike. The system matches resumes with job descriptions using cosine similarity, which is a less complicated but still efficient method than more sophisticated algorithms.

## Introduction
The study describes a state-of-the-art method that is revolutionizing hiring by effectively screening applicants through natural language processing. It uses cosine similarity to match resumes with job descriptions, improving accuracy and recruiting speed.

## Techniques
The paper offers a thorough approach that combines web development and natural language processing. It describes how cosine similarity and Python libraries were used to switch from a manual screening process to an NLP-based method that improved processing performance and efficiency.

## Experimental Findings
The outcomes show how well the system matches job descriptions with candidates. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques for text analysis and has an easy-to-use interface for uploading resumes and job descriptions. The result is a similarity percentage that shows how well a candidate and a job match.

## Summary
Through the effective development of an advanced NLP applicant screening system, the project increases the accuracy and efficiency of hiring. It opens the door for more objective, technologically sophisticated hiring procedures.
